00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,086
The parent function is the most basic function.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,574
We can apply transformations to our parent function

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:11,708
which changes its size, shape, or orientation.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,868
The parent function y equals x is known as a Linear

5
00:00:18,968 --> 00:00:22,782
function. Its parent graph has the shape of a straight diagonal

6
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:26,200
line extending through the origin of the x y plane. The

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,363
domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The range is

8
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,593
from negative infinity to positive infinity as well.

9
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:37,490
The parent function y equals x squared is known as the

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,667
Quadratic function. Its parent graph has a U shape called a

11
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:44,544
parabola. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The

12
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,775
range is from zero included in the set to positive infinity.

13
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:51,351
The parent function y equals x cubed is known as a

14
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,176
Cubic function. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity.

15
00:00:55,276 --> 00:00:58,536
The range is from negative infinity to positive infinity as well.

16
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:03,409
The parent function y equals the absolute value of x is known

17
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,793
as the Absolute Value function. Its parent graph has a recognizable V

18
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:12,559
shape. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The range

19
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,990
is from zero included in the set to positive infinity.

20
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,713
The parent function y equals b raised to the x is

21
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:23,334
known as the Exponential function. Its parent graph has the shape

22
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,565
of what is called an exponential curve. The domain is from

23
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:30,242
negative infinity to positive infinity. The range is from zero not

24
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:32,526
included in the set to positive infinity.

25
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:36,764
The parent function y equals the square root of x is

26
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:40,386
known as the Square root function. The domain is from zero

27
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:44,070
included in the set to positive infinity. The range is from

28
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,943
zero included in the set to positive infinity.
