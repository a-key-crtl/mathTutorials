00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,260
The parent function is the most basic function.

2
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:09,228
We can apply transformations to our parent function

3
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:12,802
which changes its size, shape, or orientation.

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,535

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,179
line extending through the origin of the x y plane. The

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,087
domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The range is

8
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:37,896
from negative infinity to positive infinity as well.

9
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:42,898
The parent function y equals x squared is known as the

10
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:47,211
Quadratic function. Its parent graph as a U shape called a

11
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:52,565
parabola. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The

12
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:57,027
range is from zero included in the set to positive infinity.

13
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:01,705
The parent function y equals x cubed is known as a

14
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:07,165
Cubic function. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity.

15
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:11,960
The range is from negative infinity to positive infinity as well.

16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,539
The parent function y equals the absolute value of x is known

17
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:22,731
as the Absolute Value function. Its parent graph has a recognizable V

18
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:28,374
shape. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The range

19
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:32,438
is from zero included in the set to positive infinity.

20
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,978
The parent function y equals b raised to the x is

21
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,680
known as the Exponential function. Its parent graph has the shape

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,876
of what is called an exponential curve. The domain is from

23
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:50,651
negative infinity to positive infinity. The range is from zero not

24
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,617
included in the set to positive infinity.

25
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:58,453
The parent function y equals the square root of x is

26
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:02,733
known as the Square root function. The domain is from zero

27
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:07,086
included in the set to positive infinity. The range is from

28
00:02:07,186 --> 00:02:10,480
zero included in the set to positive infinity.
