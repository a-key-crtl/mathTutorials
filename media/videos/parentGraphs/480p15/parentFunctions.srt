00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,523
The parent function is the most basic function.

2
00:00:06,666 --> 00:00:10,110
We can apply transformations to our parent function

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,306
which changes its size, shape, or orientation.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,528
The parent function y equals x is known as a Linear

5
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:26,750

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,310
line extending through the origin of the x y plane. The

7
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,864
domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The range is

8
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:41,175
from negative infinity to positive infinity as well.

9
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:46,674
The parent function y equals x squared is known as the

10
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:51,600
Quadratic function. Its parent graph has a U shape called a

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,611
parabola. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The

12
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:02,620
range is from zero included in the set to positive infinity.

13
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,787
The parent function y equals x cubed is known as a

14
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:11,553
Cubic function. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity.

15
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:15,739
The range is from negative infinity to positive infinity as well.

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,680
The parent function y equals the absolute value of x is known

17
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,183
as the Absolute Value function. Its parent graph has a recognizable V

18
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:30,077
shape. The domain is from negative infinity to positive infinity. The range

19
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:33,601
is from zero included in the set to positive infinity.

20
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:37,906
The parent function y equals b raised to the x is

21
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:42,337
known as the Exponential function. Its parent graph has the shape

22
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:46,290
of what is called an exponential curve. The domain is from

23
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,789
negative infinity to positive infinity. The range is from zero not

24
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:53,583
included in the set to positive infinity.

25
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:58,332
The parent function y equals the square root of x is

26
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:02,532
known as the Square root function. The domain is from zero

27
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:06,804
included in the set to positive infinity. The range is from

28
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:10,135
zero included in the set to positive infinity.
