1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,851
In this example we are asked to describe the transformation.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,983
Here our equation is y equals negative absolute value of x plus

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:13,183
four, then outside the absolute value sign we have a minus seven

4
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,531
If you remember, transformations are what we apply to our

5
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:21,014
parent function so let's first take out our parent function

6
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:24,615
from the equation and apply each transformation step by step.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,374
Since there is an x written inside an absolute value symbol

8
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:33,341
from our original equation, we know that y equals the absolute

9
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:36,284
value of x is going to be our parent function.

10
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:42,690
Next, we see we are adding four to x inside the absolute value symbol.

11
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:47,460
Since we are adding four inside the parent function

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,422
we will shift the graph left four units.

13
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:53,608
We are also multiplying a negative to

14
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,622
the outside of the absolute value.

15
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:59,105
A negative on the outside will reflect

16
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,397
the parent graph across the x axis.

17
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:06,118
Finally, we are subtracting seven at the end of the equation.

18
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:10,671
Our final transformation then will to shift the graph down seven

19
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,949
units. Now that we have all of our transformations laid out

20
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,781
let's see how this will transform our parent graph.

21
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:23,685
Here is our parent graph of y equals the absolute value of x.

22
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:27,717
Adding four to x inside the absolute

23
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:31,004
value shifts the graph left four units.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,217
Then if we place a negative on the outside of

25
00:01:35,317 --> 00:01:39,079
the absolute value the graph reflects over the x axis.

26
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:46,883
Lastly, we subtract seven from the whole absolute value term

27
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:51,779
which shifts our graph down seven units. After applying these

28
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:56,676
transformations, our new equation has now become y equals the

29
00:01:56,776 --> 00:02:00,770
negative absolute value of x plus four minus seven.

30
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:06,449
Let's look at another example. Again

31
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:09,356
we want to describe the transformation.

32
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,405
Here our equation is two times the absolute

33
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:15,678
value of x minus one plus three.

34
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:20,983
If you remember again, transformations are what we apply to our

35
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:25,368
parent function so let's first take out our parent function from

36
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:29,205
the equation and apply each transformation step by step.

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,752
y equals the absolute value of x is our parent function.

38
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,720
Then we subtract one from x inside the absolute value sign.

39
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:42,981
This will shift the graph right one unit.

40
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:48,485
Next we multiply two on the outside of the absolute value symbol.

41
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,871
Since two is greater than one, we will

42
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:56,170
stretch the graph by a factor of two.

43
00:02:57,266 --> 00:03:00,379
Finally we add three to the end of the equation.

44
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:04,932
Adding three will shift the graph up three

45
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:08,922
units. Now let's see how the transformations we

46
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:13,252
have ust described will transform our parent graph.

47
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,427
Here we are back to our parent graph for our

48
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:24,079
parent function y equals the absolute value of x.

49
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,650
Inside the absolute value we subtract one from x

50
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,948
which shifts the graph to the right one unit.

51
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:38,726
Then we multiply two to the outside of the absolute

52
00:03:38,826 --> 00:03:42,221
value and stretch the graph by a factor of two.

53
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:49,433
Last but not least, we add three to the absolute value term and

54
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:57,032
shift our graph up three units. So after applying our transformation, our new

55
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:03,348
function is y equals two times the absolute value of x minus one

56
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:08,973
plus three and our graphs shape and position has changed.

57
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:15,573
In our next example, we are told to translate an absolute

58
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:20,422
value function four units to the left, and seven units down.

59
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:26,528
Since we are translating an absolute value function, we know our

60
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:31,081
parent function will be y equals the absolute value of x.

61
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:36,037
This is our parent function.

62
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:42,937
Next we will add four to x inside the absolute value symbol.

63
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:50,646
This translates or shifts the function to the left four units.

64
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:56,100
Lastly, we will subtract seven.

65
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,650
This will translate function down seven units. Having applied

66
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,019
our translations let's see how this would look graphically.

67
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:13,778
Here we have an absolute value function's parent graph.

68
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:18,706
To translate left four units, we add four

69
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:22,551
to x inside the absolute value function.

70
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:29,897
Then to translate down seven units, we simply subtract seven outside the

71
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:37,038
absolute value term. So after applying our translations, our new function becomes

72
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:41,887
y equals the absolute value of x plus four minus seven.

73
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:50,172
In our next example we are asked to translate a quadratic function three

74
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:54,802
units to the right and stretch it by a factor of two.

75
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,315
Since we are asked to translate a quadratic

76
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:02,748
function, we can write y equals x squared.

77
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:08,983
This quadratic function is our parent function.

78
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:14,589
Next, we want to translate our quadratic function three units

79
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:18,137
to the right. To do this we will subtract three

80
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:22,592
from inside our parent function so the equation now becomes

81
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:26,518
y equals then in parentheses, x minus three squared.

82
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:30,810
Subtracting three inside the parentheses will

83
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,812
translate the function right three units.

84
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,173
Next we multiply by two outside the parentheses.

85
00:06:42,266 --> 00:06:46,441
This will stretch it by a factor of two. Now with all of

86
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:52,014
our translations taken care of let's see how this would look graphically.

87
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,590
Here is the parent graph of our quadratic function y equals x squared.

88
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:04,973
Subtracting three from x inside the function

89
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:08,864
will shift the graph right three units.

90
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:18,563
Then multiplying by two will stretch the graph by a factor of two.
