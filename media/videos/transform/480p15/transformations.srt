1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,307
Here we have the parent graph of

2
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:06,468
our quadratic function y equals x squared.

3
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:11,085
If we want to translate our graph up,

4
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:13,737
we simply add to the parent function.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,176
If we add 5 to the parent function, we now have y equals

6
00:00:20,276 --> 00:00:25,372
x squared plus five. This will translate the graph up five units.

7
00:00:27,466 --> 00:00:30,077
Let's restore back to our parent graph

8
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:32,574
again and remove the five we added.

9
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,720
If we wanted to translate our parent function

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,734
down, we subtract from the parent function.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,084
Subtracting three from the parent function will

12
00:00:48,184 --> 00:00:50,460
shift the graph down three units.

13
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:56,273
Removing our minus three restores our parent graph.

14
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:01,326
Now if we want to translate our graph to the

15
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:05,009
right we would subtract from inside the parent function.

16
00:01:07,066 --> 00:01:11,857
Notice we subtracted four from x inside the parentheses of our

17
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:16,037
parent function. It is x minus 4 squared instead of x

18
00:01:16,137 --> 00:01:21,006
squared minus 4. This will translate the graph right four units

19
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:25,654
Here we are back to our parent function.

20
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:33,814
To translate our graph to the left, we add to the parent function.

21
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:38,346
Adding two to x inside the parent

22
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:41,550
function shifts the graph left two units.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,779
Let's look at more transformations with another

24
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,500
parent graph, the square root function.

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,948
A negative sign on the outside shows a reflection across the x axis

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,162
So if we put a negative on the outside of our

27
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:06,004
square root we see the graph flips across the x axis.

28
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:11,470
Removing the negative restores our parent graph.

29
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:18,953
A negative sign on the inside shows a reflection across the y axis.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,715
If we apply a negative directly to x inside the square root, the

31
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:30,380
graph flips across the y axis and is now pointing to the left.

32
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:36,398
You can see the importance of where you place a negative

33
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:40,718
sign to your parent function. A negative on the outside will

34
00:02:40,818 --> 00:02:44,534
flip the graph across the x axis and a negative being

35
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:48,638
multiplied to x inside flips the graph across the y axis.

36
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,969
Let us return to our quadratic parent graph.

37
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:00,142
Multiplying by a number bigger than 1 stretches the function

38
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,257
If we multiply x squared by two, we stretch the graph

39
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:10,572
by a factor of two which makes the graph appear taller.

40
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,630
Here is our parent graph.

41
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,326
Multiplying by a number less than 1

42
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:23,638
(fraction or decimal) shrinks the function

43
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:30,255
If we multiply x squared by zero point five, we

44
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:34,031
are shrinking the graph by a factor of zero point

45
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,961
five which makes the graph appear shorter or wider.
