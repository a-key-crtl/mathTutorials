1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,125
Here we have the parent graph of

2
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:06,046
our quadratic function y equals x squared.

3
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,214
If we want to translate our graph up,

4
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:12,395
we simply add to the parent function.

5
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:18,711
If we add 5 to the parent function, we now have y equals

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:23,735
x squared plus five. This will translate the graph up five units.

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,112
Let's restore back to our parent graph

8
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:30,304
again and remove the five we added.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,664
If we wanted to translate our parent function

10
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:38,923
down, we subtract from the parent function.

11
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:43,801
Subtracting three from the parent function will

12
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:45,827
shift the graph down three units.

13
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:51,604
Removing our minus three restores our parent graph.

14
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:57,333
Now if we want to translate our graph to the

15
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,810
right we would subtract from inside the parent function.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,940
Notice we subtracted four from x inside the parentheses of our

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,335
parent function. It is x minus 4 squared instead of x

18
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:18,559
squared minus 4. This will translate the graph right four units

19
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,501
Here we are back to our parent function.

20
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,140
To translate our graph to the left, we add to the parent function.

21
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:37,080
Adding two to x inside the parent

22
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,742
function shifts the graph left two units.

23
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:45,560
Let's look at more transformations with another

24
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,905
parent graph, the square root function.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,549
A negative sign on the outside shows a reflection across the x axis

26
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:59,556
So if we put a negative on the outside of our

27
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:03,116
square root we see the graph flips across the x axis.

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,704
Removing the negative restores our parent graph.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,689
A negative sign on the inside shows a reflection across the y axis.

30
00:02:17,783 --> 00:02:22,367
If we apply a negative directly to x inside the square root, the

31
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:26,904
graph flips across the y axis and is now pointing to the left.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,861
You can see the importance of where you place a negative

33
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:37,105
sign to your parent function. A negative on the outside will

34
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:40,854
flip the graph across the x axis and a negative being

35
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:44,886
multiplied to x inside flips the graph across the y axis.

36
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:51,148
Let us return to our quadratic parent graph.

37
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:56,469
Multiplying by a number bigger than 1 stretches the function

38
00:02:58,566 --> 00:03:02,004
If we multiply x squared by two, we stretch the graph

39
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:05,676
by a factor of two which makes the graph appear taller.

40
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:10,495
Here is our parent graph.

41
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:15,243
Multiplying by a number less than 1

42
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:18,335
(fraction or decimal) shrinks the function

43
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,882
If we multiply x squared by zero point five, we

44
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:28,583
are shrinking the graph by a factor of zero point

45
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:32,435
five which makes the graph appear shorter or wider.
