1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,307
Here we have the parent graph of

2
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:06,468
our quadratic function y equals x squared.

3
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:11,120
If we want to translate our graph up,

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,772
we simply add to the parent function.

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:20,248
If we add 5 to the parent function, we now have y equals

6
00:00:20,348 --> 00:00:25,444
x squared plus five. This will translate the graph up five units.

7
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:30,149
Let's restore back to our parent graph

8
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:32,646
again and remove the five we added.

9
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,792
If we wanted to translate our parent function

10
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:42,806
down, we subtract from the parent function.

11
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:48,190
Subtracting three from the parent function will

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,566
shift the graph down three units.

13
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:56,406
Removing our minus three restores our parent graph.

14
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:01,449
Now if we want to translate our graph to the

15
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,118
right we would subtract from inside the parent function.

16
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:11,992
Notice we subtracted four from x inside the parentheses of our

17
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:16,158
parent function. It is x minus 4 squared instead of x

18
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:21,110
squared minus 4. This will translate the graph right four units

19
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,798
Here we are back to our parent function.

20
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,982
To translate our graph to the left, we add to the parent function.

21
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:38,562
Adding two to x inside the parent

22
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:41,766
function shifts the graph left two units.

23
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:47,045
Let's look at more transformations with another

24
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,766
parent graph, the square root function.

25
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:57,214
A negative sign on the outside shows a reflection across the x axis

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,462
So if we put a negative on the outside of our

27
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:06,304
square root we see the graph flips across the x axis.

28
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:11,808
Removing the negative restores our parent graph.

29
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:19,304
A negative sign on the inside shows a reflection across the y axis.

30
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:26,119
If we apply a negative directly to x inside the square root, the

31
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,784
graph flips across the y axis and is now pointing to the left.

32
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:36,810
You can see the importance of where you place a negative

33
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,123
sign to your parent function. A negative on the outside will

34
00:02:41,223 --> 00:02:44,934
flip the graph across the x axis and a negative being

35
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:49,032
multiplied to x inside flips the graph across the y axis.

36
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:55,368
Let us return to our quadratic parent graph.

37
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,544
Multiplying by a number bigger than 1 stretches the function

38
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:06,713
If we multiply x squared by two, we stretch the graph

39
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:11,040
by a factor of two which makes the graph appear taller.

40
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,104
Here is our parent graph.

41
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:20,864
Multiplying by a number less than 1

42
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:24,176
(fraction or decimal) shrinks the function

43
00:03:27,276 --> 00:03:30,797
If we multiply x squared by zero point five, we

44
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:34,573
are shrinking the graph by a factor of zero point

45
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:38,504
five which makes the graph appear shorter or wider.
